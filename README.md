# ROBOT_Arduino
Arduino program for robot to interface with BLE android app
App to control and communicate with my robot

Testing modules can be uploaded here as well, which should provide useful data to integrade a new feature into this robot.

Currently have been refactoring code for ease of facilitating additional functionality / modules. Still lots of tidying to do and removal of redundant processes, smoothing of the cycles etc.
